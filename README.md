# Twitch for WebOS
This is a simple custom Twitch client for WebOS using the [Enact framework](https://enactjs.com/). It is a proof of concept and currently is not intended for production use.

The main reason I started this project was to have a way to watch Twitch on my LG Smart TV with the third-party emotes. I'm having a hard time learning the Enact framework, and I have't touched a React code in a while, so I'm using this project to learn and practice.

Feel free to contribute, report bugs, or suggest features.

## Features
- Watch Twitch streams.
- Support for 7TV, BetterTTV, and FrankerFaceZ emotes.
- Uses the Sandstone UI, maintaning the same look and feel as the WebOS UI.

## Roadmap
- Add home page with followed channels.
- Add the ability to watch in fullscreen.
- Work on the UI.
- Publish the app on webOS Homebrew store.
